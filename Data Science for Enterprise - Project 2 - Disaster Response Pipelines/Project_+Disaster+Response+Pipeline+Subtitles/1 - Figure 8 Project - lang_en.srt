1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,394
It's time to put all of these data engineering skills to use.

2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:07,004
You have a really cool project ahead of you.

3
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:09,495
Our partners at Figure Eight are providing

4
00:00:09,494 --> 00:00:13,980
pre-labeled tweets and text messages from real life disasters.

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,045
Your task is to repair this data with an ETL Pipeline

6
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:22,765
and then use a Machine Learning Pipeline to build a supervised learning model.

7
00:00:22,765 --> 00:00:26,969
Before you start, Robert is going to give us some background on where

8
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:31,494
the dataset came from and how Figure Eight prepared the data for us.

9
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:35,160
Thank you. So, this is one of the most important problems that

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,834
we're trying to solve in Data Science and Machine Learning right now.

11
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:41,075
So following a disaster,

12
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:44,195
typically you will get millions and millions of communications

13
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:47,494
either direct or via social media right at the time

14
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:49,699
when disaster response organizations have

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,820
the least capacity to filter and then pull out the messages which are the most important.

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,880
Often it really is only one in

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:01,070
every thousand messages that might be relevant to the disaster response professionals.

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,980
So, the way that disasters are typically responded to,

19
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:07,219
is that different organizations will take care of different parts of the problem.

20
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,144
So one organization will care about water,

21
00:01:09,144 --> 00:01:11,299
another will care about blocked roads,

22
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:13,605
another will care about medical supplies.

23
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:14,984
So, when you look at the data,

24
00:01:14,984 --> 00:01:16,040
you'll see that these are

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:19,544
the categories that we have pulled out for each of these datasets.

26
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:22,069
So, we actually used Figure Eight for many of

27
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:24,829
the disasters from which these messages are taken

28
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:28,370
then combined these datasets and relabeled them so that

29
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,840
they're consistent labels across the different disasters,

30
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,659
and this is to allow you to investigate the different trends that you

31
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,724
might be able to find and to build supervised Machine Learning models.

32
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,809
So you'll see for example,

33
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,325
when you look at a keyword like water,

34
00:01:44,325 --> 00:01:47,299
that's actually a very small percent of the time that,

35
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,039
that will map to someone who needs

36
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,200
fresh drinking water and also that will miss people who say they're thirsty,

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,659
but don't use the word, "Water."

38
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,069
So, supervised Machine Learning-based approaches are going

39
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:01,514
to be a lot more accurate than anyone could do with keyword searching,

40
00:02:01,515 --> 00:02:05,450
but this is actually a big gap right now in disaster response contexts.

41
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,789
So, I really look forward to seeing what you build in your projects and hopefully

42
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,889
discover new trends and new ways of building

43
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:17,314
Machine Learning models that can help us respond to future disasters.

44
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:22,034
One of my favorite parts about this project is how meaningful the work is.

45
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:24,829
Think about the benefits this solution brings to

46
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,405
people affected by natural disasters around the world.

47
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:29,900
In the next section,

48
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,800
you'll find more instructions on how to complete the project,

49
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,140
including an overview of the provided code and a rubric.

50
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,039
Good luck with your projects and I look forward to seeing the results.
