1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,375
In this project, you're going to be analyzing thousands of real messages,

2
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,985
provided by Figure Eight,

3
00:00:11,985 --> 00:00:14,870
that were sent during natural disasters,

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,025
either via social media or directly to disaster response organizations.

5
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:26,610
You'll build an ETL pipeline that processes message and category data from CSV files,

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,270
and load them into a SQLite database,

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,580
which our machine learning pipeline will then read from to

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,435
create and save a multi-output supervised learning model.

9
00:00:36,435 --> 00:00:42,885
Then, your web app will extract data from this database to provide data visualizations,

10
00:00:42,885 --> 00:00:47,985
and use your model to classify new messages for 36 categories.

11
00:00:47,985 --> 00:00:50,990
Machine learning is critical to helping

12
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,550
different organizations understand which messages are relevant to them,

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:58,010
and which messages to prioritize.

14
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,470
During these disasters is when they have

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,250
the least capacity to filter out messages that matter,

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,820
and find basic messages such as using keyword searches to provide trivial results.

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,514
In this course, you'll learn the skills you need in ETL pipelines,

18
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:17,070
natural language processing, and machine learning

19
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,170
pipelines to create an amazing project with real-world significance.
